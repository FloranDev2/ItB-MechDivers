## Description

### Emancipator Mech
Equipped with Dual Autocannons and Stratagems.
The Dual Autocannons can shoot from either side of the Mech.
The Stratagems are a collections of various call-ins, ranging from weapons' drop to orbital strikes.
One Stratagem is added to the available list at each mission's start.

### Patriot Mech
Equipped with a Machine Gun, a Rocket Pods and Stratagems.
Patriot's weapon is a weapon with two modes:
- Machine Gun: shoots a projectile that deals more damage if the target is damaged. If the target is killed, the projectile continues its trajectory, with damage equal to excess damage.
- Rocket Pods: shoots a limited-use powerful rocket diagonally. If it kills its target, it damages surrounding tiles.

### Shuttle Mech
Equipped with Delivery and Reinforcements passive.
Delivery has multiple uses:
- Strafe attack: leap and shoots lateral and front tiles while moving. The damage is reduced for each possible target (any unit or building), to a minimum of 1 damage.
Reinforcements call down new Mechs piloted by rooky pilots when a Mech is destroyed.

## Notes
This mod is likely to break with other mods since it does some "experimental stuff", especially with the Mechs' reinforcement mechanic, which REMOVES the destroyed Mech and create a new Mech.
This new Mech has a new id, so any mod that assumes that Mechs are Pawns with ids ranging from 0 to 2 will break with this.
